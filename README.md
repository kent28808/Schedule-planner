## Description

This is my fourth project, where I was tasked with creating a Code quiz with questions and answers of my choosing.
This application was created with CSS, HTML and Javascript.  The app, allows the user to review a question and select one of the (4) multiple choice answers provided.
There is also a timer that will start counting down from 5 minutes and 0 seconds once the user clicks on the start game button.  
If the answer selected is incorrect, 10 seconds will be removed from the countdown.  
Once the quiz has been completed, the user has the option to enter their initials for a High Score record.
